# **SQL Challenge Week 1: Danny's Diner üçú**

## Welcome to SQL Challenge Week 1: Danny's Diner! 
- I'm excited to introduce the SQL Challenged brought to you by [Data with Danny] (https://www.datawithdanny.com/), and I kicked off this challenge with study case #1: [Danny's Diner] (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).

## Challenge Overview
- Danny's Diner is a fictional data analysis challenge that involves working with a dataset from a restaurant named "Danny's Diner." The challenge typically provides participants with a database containing various tables, such as customer data, menu items, reservations, and transaction history. 

## Problem Statement
- My task in this challenge is to dive in and uncover some seriously delectable insights. There are three main questions to tackle:

- 1. **Popular Dishes**: Determining which menu items are the most frequently ordered by customers.
- 2. **Peak Dining Hours**: Exploring when the restaurant experiences peak hours of customer activity, helping to optimize staffing and service.
- 3. **Reservation Patterns**: Investigating how far in advance customers typically make reservations, which can inform reservation management.

**12. Rank all the things**
- Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
