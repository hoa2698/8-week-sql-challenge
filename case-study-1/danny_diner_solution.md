# **SQL Challenge Week 1: Danny's Diner üçú**

## Welcome to SQL Challenge Week 1: Danny's Diner! 
I'm excited to introduce the SQL Challenged brought to you by [Data with Danny] (https://www.datawithdanny.com/), and I kicked off this challenge with study case #1: [Danny's Diner] (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).

## Challenge Overview
Danny's Diner is a fictional data analysis challenge that involves working with a dataset from a restaurant named "Danny's Diner." The challenge typically provides participants with a database containing various tables, such as customer data, menu items, reservations, and transaction history. 

## Problem Statement
My task in this challenge is to dive in and uncover some seriously delectable insights. There are three main questions to tackle:

1. **Popular Dishes**: Determining which menu items are the most frequently ordered by customers.
2. **Peak Dining Hours**: Exploring when the restaurant experiences peak hours of customer activity, helping to optimize staffing and service.
3. **Reservation Patterns**: Investigating how far in advance customers typically make reservations, which can inform reservation management.

## Case Study Questions
1. **What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
2. **How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
3. **What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
4. **What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
5. **Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
6. **Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
7. **Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
8. **What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
9. **If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
10. **In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
